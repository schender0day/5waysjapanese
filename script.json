    "translation": "I like you",
    "pronunciation": "A-na-ta ga su-ki de-su",
    "context": "In Japan, confessing your liking towards someone is often done subtly. The phrase 'Anata ga suki desu' can be used in various contexts, whether you like someone in a romantic sense, or you appreciate someone's company or characteristics.",
    "breakdown": "The first part, 'anata', means 'you'. 'ga' is a subject marker. 'Suki' is the term for 'like' or 'love' and 'desu' is a polite ending for the sentence. So, you're essentially saying 'As for you, (I) like'.",
